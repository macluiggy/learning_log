python -m venv ll_env 

2. Activate the virtual environment

source ll_env/bin/activate
to desactivate: deactivate

to migrate:
python manage.py migrate

to run de server:
python manage.py runserver

if you make a change in the models, you need to migrate again:
python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs

to apply this migration:
python manage.py migrate

whenever we want to modify the data that learning_logs manages, we follow three steps:
1. Create a new model or modify an existing one
2. call makemigrations
3. call migrate
