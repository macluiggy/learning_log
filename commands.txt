to migrate:
python manage.py migrate

python manage.py runserver

if you make a change in the models, you need to migrate again:
python manage.py makemigrations learning_logs

to apply this migration:
python manage.py migrate

whenever we want to modify the data that learning_logs manages, we follow three steps:
1. Create a new model or modify an existing one
2. call makemigrations
3. call migrate

to enter to python shell:
python manage.py shell

to manage a model:
from learning_logs.models import Topic

to get all the topics:
Topic.objects.all()

to get a specific topic:
Topic.objects.get(id=1)

to get all the entries of a topic:
topic = Topic.objects.get(id=1)
topic.entry_set.all()

to start a new app
django-admin startapp app_name
